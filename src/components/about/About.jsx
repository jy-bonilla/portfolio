            <p>
                I'm a software developer based in Northern Virginia.
            </p>
            <p>
                My focus is on creating websites whicha are accesible,
                responsive and customer driven. The technologies which I'm currently
                using to achieve these goals are HTML/CSS and JavaScript on the client side,
                Node.js and Express on the server side along with the React framework.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
