            <p>Aspiring software engineer with 5 years of clinical data analysis. Recently,
                I pivoted my career from the lab sciences to software engineering due to my
                passion for software technologies, love of learning and problem-solving abilities.

                Currently, I focus on creating websites which are accesible,
                responsive and customer driven. The technologies which I'm currently
                using to achieve these goals are HTML/CSS and JavaScript on the client side,
                Node.js and Express on the server side along with the React framework.
